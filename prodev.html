				As a financial services professional, my on-line and social media presence was very limited due to compliance, regulation, and solicitation requirements. I have very little on-line presence other than LinkedIn and the data assoicated with my business, licenses, and registrations. A google search will show lots of Peter Streets, especially on facebook, but none of the individuals is me.

	Week 0, the first week of class was tough for me. I was very ill and just able to keep up with the minimum requirments. I did get to the doctor on the long weekend and was feeling a lot better in Week 1. Fortunatly, I have a bit of database and SQL experience so I was able to catch up. I find reading program documents, watching screencasts, and parsing on-line code examples in the evenings and on the weekends very helpful.
