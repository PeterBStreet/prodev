				As a financial services professional, my on-line and social media presence was very limited due to compliance, regulation, and solicitation requirements. I have very little on-line presence other than LinkedIn and the data assoicated with my business, licenses, and registrations. A google search will show lots of Peter Streets, especially on facebook, but none of the individuals is me.

	Week 2 was a productive week for me. Although frustrating at times, working through the details of tables and object oriented coding/programing is starting to make sence to me. Eliot Oestling agreed to be my tutor and I am excited to start working with him next week. We will meet on Tuesday evening durring the TedTalk. I am spending a majority of my study time reviewing the bootcamp-coders website, reading documentation, and writing sample code.
