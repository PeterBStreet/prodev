	Week 3 started well for me. I spent alot of time studying CSS and OOP and they are both starting to make sense to me. I am working on templates for CSS and OOP in preperation for the CapStone project. Our team had a challenge getting the ERD approved this weekend as there was no bridge support on Slack from Saturday noon thru Monday morning. I am disappointed about the lack of feedback from the bridge this weekend. Their complete lack of communication over the weekend was unprofessional. In the future, if the bridge can not meet their committment to support the class on Slack, the bridge needs to notify the class that they are going off-line so the team can adjust their expectations and alter their schedule.
