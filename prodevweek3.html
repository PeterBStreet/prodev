				As a financial services professional, my on-line and social media presence was very limited due to compliance, regulation, and solicitation requirements. I have very little on-line presence other than LinkedIn and the data assoicated with my business, licenses, and registrations. A google search will show lots of Peter Streets, especially on facebook, but none of the individuals is me.
